# Work Experience Notes
## Day 1 Notes


- Create definitions for bash commands used (ls, cd, pwd)
    - ls: Lists directory contents; allows you to know what files are located in the directory.
    - cd: Changes directory; changes the directory you're in so that you can get info, manipulate, and read the different files and directories in your system
    - pwd: Prints working directory; pwd is used to print the current directory you're in. If you have multiple terminals operating and need to remember which directory you're working in, or if you're just unsure, the pwd command will tell you.
- Make different md documents for managing goals
    - Completed
- Get a definition for what a directory is
    - A directory is a unique type of file that contains only the information needed to access files or other directories. Because of this directories occupy less space than other files. 
- Explain how and why you clone a repository
    - You copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. This makes it easier to add or remove files, push larger commits, and to fix merge conflicts. To clone a repository you open the file menu, click **Clone Repository**, then click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone, or click **URL** to manually enter the repository location. From the list of repositories select the repository you want to clone. Then choose a local directory to clone the repository to from the local path field. Then, at the bottom of the window, click **Clone**.
- Look and experiment with markdown formats
    - Done whilst creating this document but here's some more:
        - Bold Text: **Hello**
        - Italicised Text: *Hello*
        - Bold and Italicised Text: ***Hello***
