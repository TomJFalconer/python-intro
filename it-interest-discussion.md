# Does IT Interest Me?
## Day 1:
So far I find it pretty interesting, there's still lots I'm confused/unsure about but it's pretty fun for now. I like the challenges and how you have to overcome them. 
## Day 2:
Today it was fun creating code, but at some points it got repetitive and a bit slow/boring. I still enjoyed majority of it though. 
## Day 3:
Still found it quite interesting, it was fun to try and find solutions to overcome different challenges I faced throughout the day. It's fun but I can imagine it getting repetitive.
## Day 4:
Did less IT-based work today, but the IT work I did was pretty good.
