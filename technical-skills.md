## Challenges and Learning Opportunities
### Day 1:
- I struggled to get ASCII art imported into my markdown documents, but I found a work around that allowed the formatting to not be effected.
- I learnt new tricks on markdown like headings, text effects (italics, bold), and lists. 
### Day 2: 
- I learnt how to do many different things in python like creating windows, labels, buttons and entries. I began working on a digital version of my work experience form but it seems like it will take a while. I had to research how to add a scrollbar to my window since I ran out of space, and I will hopefully finish the scrollbar tomorrow. 
### Day 3:
- The scrollbar unfortunately was a bit complicated, after more work I feel like eventually I could've gotten it finished, but with the time I had I chose to ignore it since it seemed like I would have to redo majority of my work if I did incorporate it. Instead of using a scrollbar I chose to add buttons that open up new windows to continue the form in. This worked better. I buttons add up to a score and made a new window to display that score. Tomorrow I will finish off the form once I figure out how to print data recieved from an Entry.
